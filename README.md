## Project Overview

![https://github.com/gabriel-alves-p/l-atelier-eden](documentation/images/responsive-website.jpeg)

This website was created as a user-centric project with the main goal of generating business by the means of a booking form whilst providing any information the customer might like to enquire about (E.g. about us information, menus, contact information, location and job applications). The website consists a landing page which has a hero video with a logo standing out in its center, an about us section, a menus section and a contact details section. It then has two separate pages dedicated to job applications and a booking form, respectively. All pages share the same fixed navigation bar at the top and footer at the bottom.

## UX

### Project Goals

- The website targets adults within the UK whom are highly eager to indulge in a fine-dining experience out of the ordinary and for skilled hospitality workers looking to make the next move in their careers.

- The website was designed to be easy to read and intuitive, with information about the restaurant, menus, contact details (including social media links) and our address all found in the home page.

- The footer contains policy information and gives the user the option to sign up to our weekly newsletter, to stay in touch and make the restaurant feel that little bit friendlier.

- The job application form and booking forms have their own dedicated pages to make the action of interacting with the restaurant feel like an activity separate from the informative part of the website and a more immersive experience.

- The website was also designed with a thought of "less is more" kept in mind, whilst it showcases luxury, it is also simple enough to be scanned by the user very quickly and the font styles demonstrate that.

- The website is responsive from the largest desktop viewports to the smallest phone viewports.

#### User Goals

> - As a new customer, I want to know what type of dining the restaurant offers (e.g. casual dining, fine dining, sharing plates etc.) upon reaching the landing page, so I can decide to either leave or stay within the first scan.
> - As a new customer, I want to easily find out more information about the restaurant, its accolades and the Chef whom runs the restaurant, so I know what kind of standards to expect.

### Design Choices

#### Strategy Plane

The website's ultimate goal is to advertise their work, accquire new customers and generate profit by means of showcasing the high standards in which the restaurant opperates to and how much care goes into producing such experiences for the customers.
The target audience are adults aged 20 years and over whom are interested in fine-dining.

#### Scope Plane

Features, based on the strategy plane, that made it onto the website include:
> - A hero video showcasing the restaurant's outdoors, indoors and table planning.
> - A logo that stands out over the hero video.
> - A fixed and simple navigation bar at the top of the screen.
> - An about us section explaining the restaurant's ethos and accolades.
> - Images of the food to separate the sections
> - A section showcasing our different menus and prices.
> - Images of the food next to each menu.
> - A section containing our opening hours, contact details and location with an iframe for an address on Google Maps.
> - A separate page containing information about job applications.
> - Images of staff working happily.
> - An application form containing text, email, file, reset and submit inputs.
> - A separate page containing information about how to make a booking.
> - A booking form containing text, email, number, date, radio and submit inputs.
> - A fixed and simple navigation bar across all pages.
> - A simple footer across all pages.

#### Structure Plane

The information on the home was designed to be structured by priority, so that the first thing the customer reads as they scroll down is a description of what the restaurant does and what it has achieved in the past. That gives the user more confidence as they scroll down to the second section, which contain the menus and the prices. Finally the user finds the contact information and address, grouped together.

The same format was followed across the bookings and job application pages, with a brief overview of the topic to give the user more information and confidence to scroll down and fill out the forms.

The same navigation bar and footer are found across all three pages, to provide the user with intuitiviness.

#### Skeleton Plane

At the early stages of UXD planning, it was decided that the navigation bar would be fixed at the top of the screen, containing links to each and every section on the website, being the main way the user will navigate through the website. A hero-video with the restaurant's logo highlighted in the center would be used to set the feeling for the website at the landing page.

Followed then by the 'about us' section, which would then contain two pictures that contrasted with the page's background color, to create a division.
It would then be followed by a brief introduction to the menus, then the menus would follow, covering 50% of the screen, each with an image linked to a dish on the menus covering the remaining 50% of the screen.

A 'contact us' section would then follow, as per the priority levels decided in the structure plane. This section would cover 100% of the screen width and contain both information about how to get in touch with the restaurant, should the user require to do so, and the location including a Google Maps iframe.

The landing page ends with a footer containing terms & conditions, privacy policy and cookie policy on the left side of the screen and an option to subscribe to the restaurant's newsletter on the right.

The careers and bookings pages would contain the same navigation bar and footer, with a heading and a few paragraphs introducing the user to the page, followed by the forms, which would contain the same styling and same fixed background style to keep in accordance with the website's design.

#### Colors

- The color palette was chosen with the thought of luxury in mind. The two colors chosen for the website's feel are represented by emerald-like and golden-like colors that definitely represent the type of experience the restaurant offers.

![Website's color palette](documentation/images/color-palette.jpeg)

#### Typography

- The fonts were chosen purely aesthetically. The logo font (Libre Baskerville) was chosen to give the user a sense of finesse and class. Whilst the content font (Lato) was chosen to be a simple, clean and easy to read font, so it is easy on the eyes of the user whilst reading or scanning through the content.
- include screenshots of fonts used and links to the appropriate website ex) https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway

#### Images

- The images found on the website were chosen to showcase the culinary and the hospitality of the restaurant, they were chosen to contrast with the background color of the website and stand out from any other features on the website.
- The icons were chosen to be simple and have a minimal ::hover effect. They are there to add extra finesse to the menus and to give the social media links a more interesting look.
- The thought process behind these was "a picture speaks a thousand words".
- Screenshot of pictures.
- Screenshot of icons.

#### Animations

- Social media icons scale up when hovered over.

- screenshot of media icons.

#### Transitions

- Smooth scrolling added to the website when directed to a section on home page through the navigation bar.

- Hero images transition via means of a video added to the header.

### Wireframes

- Wireframes sketched for this project can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_isDYdImHXlCSWMB9GdZRoAzCxiXuB5I/view?usp=sharing).

### Features

This project consists of three distinct pages: home page, careers and bookings. They have all been designed to be responsive for all mobile and desktop devices.

#### Home Page

- It acts as the landing page for the website and contains all the main information the user could be looking for, structured in a priority order. It contains information about the restaurant, menus and prices, contact information and location. It was designed this way to be intuititve and make sure the user does not have to look hard at all to find important information.

#### Careers

- The careers page stands out on its own, separate from the main content, as it is my understanding most users will not be interested in this section. Nonetheless, it still feels very much a part of the same website, with the same type of heading and paragraph content to introduce you to the section, followed by staff pictures to give the page more of a purpose-filled feel, then it informs the user of the positions available for application, and finally the application form, kept as simple and in accordance with the design of the website as possible.

#### Booking

- The bookings page, much like the careers page, is found separate from the main content. It is however, for a different reason. The page is kept separate to make the act of booking a table exclusive and immersive to the user. It includes the same format of the careers page, a heading, paragraph content to inform the user, and then finally the booking form, where the user can submit their details in for an experience with the restaurant,

#### Navigation Bar

- All three pages share the same fixed navigation bar at the top, keeping in format with the intuitivity of the website, helping the user get anywhere, from anywhere.

#### Footer

- All three pages share the same footer at the bottom of the page, keeping it uniform and making sure the user can get to the footer regardless of which page they are on.

#### Responsiveness

- All pages have been designed to be responsive from the largest of desktop devices to the smallest of mobile devices.

### Future Features

- In the future I would like to implemment an OpenTable calendar iframe to the bookings form, making it easier to book a table.
- screenshot of calendar

- In the future, I would like to introduce separate pages for "terms of use, privacy policy & cookies policy".

### Manual Testing

- Manual Testing for this project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1acPB5xdVpJIHv4YUpYRCyhFIdUnEWh5nJjfzOq_zecE/edit#gid=87359594).

### Defect Tracking

You should mention  any  bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

Here is a [Defect Tracking Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tYB4X4wTCNEW_Y1no3hsGbclh2bLokl_I5Ev3s5EuJA/edit?usp=sharing) you use as a starting point to track defects. Make a copy of the sheet to your own account and update the Features sheet to match your project. 


### Defects of Note
Some defects are more pesky than others. Highlight 3-5 of the bugs that drove you the most nuts and how you finally ended up resolving them.


### Outstanding Defects
It's ok to not resolve all the defects you found. If you know of something that isn't quite right, list it out and explain why you chose not to resolve it.

## Accessibility

Accessibility testing is aimed to make sure that those with visual or physical disabilities can still browse your website. Some users have had strokes or accidents that make it difficult to use a mouse so they use keyboard keys to tab through sites. Others use screen readers that rely on HTML tags to help the user navigate quickly through the site to find information they want, others have color blindness or contrast issues. It's the law to provide services 
Here's a [site](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#:~:text=Accessibility%20is%20Important%20for%20Individuals%2C%20Businesses%2C%20Society,-The%20Web%20is&text=That%20is%2C%20the%20accessibility%20barriers,older%20people) where you can learn more about accessibility and the internet.

### Lighthouse Audits
You should run your deployed website pages through lighthouse's audit to check performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO scores. You should aim to get 85 or higher score. 
https://web.dev/measure/  If you have lower scores, read the report and follow the links to address the flagged issues. You can run this tool from Chrome Dev Tools too against your local machine, but the performance will the worst (I personally ignore my performance results unless it's deployed code. I hope for > 60 on that mark, but > 85 on the other 3)

### Keyboard Navigation
Another way to accessibility test you site is to try to click on the browser and see what happens if you use the tab, arrow and enter keys. Does it work well or does the user get stuck?


## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages).

Enumerate steps and use screenshots to make the instructions are clear.


You may want to re-watch the [initial deployment in gitpod video](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+LR101+2021_T1/courseware/4a07c57382724cfda5834497317f24d5/9b06129195c64fada6783de9cfe82d60/) when writing up this section.


Write out steps you would take and test them to deploy your code to GitHub Pages, include screenshots if you think they would make the process easier.

## Credits

To avoid plagiarism amd copyright infringement, you should mention any other projects, stackoverflow, videos, blogs, etc that you used to gather imagery or ideas for your code even if you used it as a starting point and modified things. Giving credit to other people's efforts and ideas that saved you time acknowledges the hard work others did. 

### Content

Use bullet points to list out sites you copied text from and cross-reference where those show up on your site

### Media

Make a list of sites you used images from. If you used several sites try to match up each image to the correct site. This includes attribution for icons if they came from font awesome or other sites, give them credit.

### Acknowledgments

This is the section where you refer to code examples, mentors, blogs, stack overflow answers and videos that helped you accomplish your end project. Even if it's an idea that you updated you should note the site and why it was important to your completed project.

If you used a CodeInstitute Example project as a starting point. Make note of that here.
