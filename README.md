## Project Overview

![https://github.com/gabriel-alves-p/l-atelier-eden](documentation/images/responsive-website.jpeg)

This website was created as a user-centric project with the main goal of generating business by the means of a booking form whilst providing any information the customer might like to enquire about (E.g. about us information, menus, contact information, location and job applications). The website consists a landing page which has a hero video with a logo standing out in its center, an about us section, a menus section and a contact details section. It then has two separate pages dedicated to job applications and a booking form, respectively. All pages share the same fixed navigation bar at the top and footer at the bottom.

## UX

### Project Goals

- The website targets adults within the UK whom are highly eager to indulge in a fine-dining experience out of the ordinary and for skilled hospitality workers looking to make the next move in their careers.

- The website was designed to be easy to read and intuitive, with information about the restaurant, menus, contact details (including social media links) and our address all found in the home page.

- The footer contains policy information and gives the user the option to sign up to our weekly newsletter, to stay in touch and make the restaurant feel that little bit friendlier.

- The job application form and booking forms have their own dedicated pages to make the action of interacting with the restaurant feel like an activity separate from the informative part of the website and a more immersive experience.

- The website was also designed with a thought of "less is more" kept in mind, whilst it showcases luxury, it is also simple enough to be scanned by the user very quickly and the font styles demonstrate that.

- The website is responsive from the largest desktop viewports to the smallest phone viewports.

#### User Goals

> - As a new customer, I want to know what type of dining the restaurant offers (e.g. casual dining, fine dining, sharing plates etc.) upon reaching the landing page, so I can decide to either leave or stay within the first scan.
> - As a new customer, I want to easily find out more information about the restaurant, its accolades and the Chef whom runs the restaurant, so I know what kind of standards to expect.
> - As a new customer, I want to find out more about menus and prices, so I can decide wether the cuisine suits my taste and/or is worth the price.
> - As a new customer, I want to be able to see plenty of pictures of the food, so I can best decide wether to go ahead and book a table or not.
> - As a new customer, I want to be able to find out if the restaurant can accomodate any of my possible dietary requirements (e.g. veganism, vegetarianism, allergies, etc.), so I can go ahead with the booking or leave the page.
> - As a new customer, I want to be able to find out the address of the restaurant without having to contact its customer services, so I can see how far I would have to travel were I to book a table.
> - As a new customer, I want to be able to find out about the restaurant's opening hours and to be able to contact them via a telephone number and/or email address.
> - As a new customer, I want to be able to view what the cancellation policy is and how it affects me.
> - Both as a new and existing customer, I want to be able to succesfully book a table for either lunch or dinner.
> - Both as a new and existing customer, I want to have the option of signing up to a newsletter, so I can hear more about special menu offers.
> - Both as a new and existing customer, I want to be positively impacted by the color tones of the website.
> - Both as a new and existing customer, I want to intuitively read and/or scan the website and find it easy on the eyes.
> - As an existing customer, I want to be able to find menus and menu prices, so I can see if they have changed.
> - As a job-seeker, I want to be able to find out more about the restaurant's ethos and what kind of cuisine and standards the restaurant works towards, so I can best decide if it suits me.
> - As a job-seeker, I want to be able to find out if the restaurant is currently hiring for the position I am looking for.
> - As a job-seeker, I want to be able to successfully apply for a role and know what to expect after doing so.

#### Developer Goals

> - As a developer, I hope to have exceeded my client's expectations.
> - As a developer, I hope to have created an aesthetically pleasing website.
> - As a developer, I hope to have learned more about my code writting skills and improve upon the mistakes made.
> - As a developer, I hope to have learned how to write cleaner code and implement such skill onto my next project.
> - As a developer, I hope to have learned more about myself and how to persevere upon encountering bugs in my code.

#### Website Owner Goals

> - As an owner, I want to easily express the luxiouriousness in the experience offered by my business.
> - As an owner, I want to make sure the user finds the website easy to read and intuitive.
> - As an owner, I want to showcase pictures of my restaurant and the food so customers may be drawn in.
> - As an owner, I want to make the booking action as easy and intuitive as possible, with as little information to be filled out as necessary for a successful booking.
> - As an owner, I want to have our contact information and opening hours displayed so new customers have option to get in touch with us would they choose to do so.
> - As an owner, I want to ultimately generate more business by means of a booking system.
> - As an owner, I want to provide potential job applicants with enough information about the website to help them decide wether the job would suit them or not.

### Design Choices

Strategy Plane

The website's ultimate goal is to accquire new customers and generate profit by means of showcasing the high standards in which the restaurant opperates and how much care goes into producing such experiences for the customers.

#### Colors

- Discuss your color pallet choices and how it ties into users' emotions or target audience.
- include a screenshot of your pallet using a tool like coolors.co

#### Typography

- discuss font size, font types for headers vs buttons vs general text and how it ties into users' emotions or target audience.
- include screenshots of fonts used and links to the appropriate website ex) https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway

#### Images

Explain why you used certain icons and images on your site

#### Design Elements

- list out the type of elements you want to use on your site, this will help you  when choosing a framework and goes hand in hand when doing the wireframes. If you did something out of the ordinary, or think something was particularly clever, add a sentence and a screenshot or reference the file the code or css is in.

> - top menu (desktop navigation)
> - sidebar menu (mobile navigation)
> - footer
> - containers/cards
> - buttons
> - text input
> - textarea inputs
> - dropdowns
> - modals/layers
> - check boxes
> - switches
> - accordions
> - pagination
> - datepickers
> - maps
> - images
> - tooltips
> - icons

#### Animations and Transitions

- discuss any special animations or transitions you've included 
- special hover state effects

### Wireframes

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in a separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

### Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

#### Implemented Features

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

It's easiest to break this section down into the header, footer, layer, and each page of your website. Call out any differences for mobile vs desktop presentations, include a screenshot.

Don't forget your 404 error page.

#### Future Features

Use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

If you end up not developing some features you hoped to implement, you can include those in this section.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- If you included a js file that isn't your own, add it here.

- If you included a css file that isn't your own, add it here.

- Common 3rd party technologies to list:
  - wirefames
  - favicons
  - color palette images
  - fonts
  - CSS Frameworks
  - markdown tables
  - markdown table of contents
  
Please note, if this gets more than 5 items, you may want to break it down into logical subsections

### Programing Languages
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com) The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) The project uses **CSS** to define DOM appearance. 
- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) The project uses **HTML** to define DOM elements.
- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) Documentation within the readme was generated using markdown

### Frameworks and Extensions
- [Bootstrap 4.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) Rather than re-invent many things, I chose to customize the look and feel of bootstrap 4.0 
- [google sheets & drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mYY4M0jXf6sPWesmP9Q-wFvjpgT1v8IU?usp=sharing) - Used to create testing documents and project plan (feature to do list) 

### Fonts
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?m=free) - for icons associated with buttons and inputs
- [Patrick Hand SC](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patrick+Hand+SC) - Google Font's Patrick Hand font was used for headers and home page dialog
- [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) - Google's Raleway font was used as the main font

### Tools
- [github](https://github.com/) - used for version control of project files and branching out to try different things without adversely affecting a functional set of code
- [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - used to create professional looking wire frames.
- [markdown table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) - used to help with documentation table formatting
- [mardown table of contents generator](https://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/) - used to create table of contents (be weary it does have some bugs if you have dashes or trailing spaces in your headers)
- [colors.co](https://coolors.co/) I used a colors.co's color pallet tool to help pick complementary colors.

### APIs
- [SMTP](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.8/Lib/smtplib.py) - Send emails to users 
- [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers-dot-devsite-v2-prod.appspot.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/) - Customized Mapping Widgets


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Validation Testing
You should try to ensure you code is valid and follows proper indentation.  In this section you should write up any websites you used to validate your code. As your projects becomes more complex these tools may change.

- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) Note, any error associated with root: color variables were ignored.
- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

### Cross Browser and Cross Device Testing
Create a table that lists out what devices, browsers, and operating system you tested your application on and a brief description of why you chose the mixture you did. The point is to prove that you looked at the site across various browsers, operating systems, and viewport breakpoints.

| TOOL / Device                 | BROWSER     | OS         | SCREEN WIDTH  |
|-------------------------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| real phone: motog6            | chrome      | android    | XS 360 x 640  |
| browser stack: iPhone5s       | safari      | iOs        | XS 320 x 568  |
| dev tools emulator: pixel 2   | firefox     | android    | SM 411 x 731  |
| browserstack: iPhone 10x      | Chrome      | iOs        | SM 375 x 812  |
| browserstack: nexus 7 - vert  | Chrome      | android    | M 600 x 960   |
| real tablet: ipad mini - vert | safari      | iOs        | M 768 x 1024  |
| browserstack: nexus 7 - horiz | firefox     | android    | LG 960 x 600  |
| chrome emulator: ipad - horiz | safari      | iOs        | LG 1024 x 768 |
| browserstack                  | Chrome      | windows    | XL 1920 x 946 |
| real computer: mac book pro   | safari 12.1 | Mohave     | XL 1400 x 766 |
| browserstack                  | IE Edge 88  | windows 10 | XL 1920 x 964 |

### Automated Testing
Whenever it is feasible, automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

If you did not run automating testing. State why you chose not to.

### Manual Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
    
Here is a [Manual Testing Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/189VpSeEG9oevSRhvb2WZl8zCk9L3s2iWQyrJ_1jjAGQ/edit?usp=sharing) that you can use as a starting point to keep track of your testing efforts. Make a copy of it in your own account and update as needed to reflect the browsers you are testing and features.  

It's ok to spot check specific functionality across devices and browsers but each page should be viewed as a whole for each device/browser combo at least once.

A quick way to check if items are exceeding the screen width of a project is to run this javascript in the console for various screen emulations:

```
var docWidth = document.documentElement.offsetWidth;
[].forEach.call(document.querySelectorAll('*'),function(el){if(el.offsetWidth > docWidth){console.log(el);}});
```

### Defect Tracking

You should mention  any  bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

Here is a [Defect Tracking Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tYB4X4wTCNEW_Y1no3hsGbclh2bLokl_I5Ev3s5EuJA/edit?usp=sharing) you use as a starting point to track defects. Make a copy of the sheet to your own account and update the Features sheet to match your project. 


### Defects of Note
Some defects are more pesky than others. Highlight 3-5 of the bugs that drove you the most nuts and how you finally ended up resolving them.


### Outstanding Defects
It's ok to not resolve all the defects you found. If you know of something that isn't quite right, list it out and explain why you chose not to resolve it.


## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any.

Remember to use proper markdown for commands and enumerated steps.

### Deploy Locally

Write out the steps you take starting from cloning the repository in github or clicking a gitpod button to run your code locally. Test it out and make sure it works. This can be running from your IDE of choice like VSCode or PyCharm or GitPod.

You may want to re-watch the [initial deployment in gitpod video](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:codeinstitute+FE+2017_T3/courseware/dcd449bd41a446f49df3268f91dd06fc/072c95175f1148438de9d82e7a756ee1/?child=first) when writing up this section.

### Deploy To GitHub Pages

Write out steps you would take and test them to deploy your code to GitHub Pages.

## Credits

To avoid plagiarism amd copyright infringement, you should mention any other projects, stackoverflow, videos, blogs, etc that you used to gather imagery or ideas for your code even if you used it as a starting point and modified things. Giving credit to other people's efforts and ideas that saved you time acknowledges the hard work others did. 

### Content

Use bullet points to list out sites you copied text from and cross-reference where those show up on your site

### Media

Make a list of sites you used images from. If you used several sites try to match up each image to the correct site. This includes attribution for icons if they came from font awesome or other sites, give them credit.

### Acknowledgments

This is the section where you refer to code examples, mentors, blogs, stack overflow answers and videos that helped you accomplish your end project. Even if it's an idea that you updated you should note the site and why it was important to your completed project.

If you used a CodeInstitute Example project as a starting point. Make note of that here.
